# Capital Bike Share Utilization Focus

## Project Overview
Capital Bike is a bike-sharing initiative aimed at providing a convenient and eco-friendly transportation solution. This project now prioritizes **bike utilization rates** to help the supply team optimize bike availability, reduce shortages, and ensure an efficient redistribution of bikes across stations.

## Key Objectives
- **Improve Bike Availability:** Identify critical stations with high demand but low bike availability.
- **Optimize Redistribution:** Support the supply team by highlighting stations that frequently run out of bikes.
- **Enhance Utilization Efficiency:** Reduce bike idleness and balance supply based on demand patterns.

## Utilization Rate Analysis
The dataset focuses on **station-level bike usage**, incorporating:
- **Trip Count:** The number of rides that started from each station.
- **Number of Bikes Available:** The count of available bikes at each station at a given time.
- **Utilization Rate:** 
  Utilization Rate =Trip Count/Number of Bikes Available

  
  This metric indicates how frequently bikes are being used relative to their availability.

### **Utilization Insights:**
- **High Utilization (Red Markers):** Stations with no available bikes frequently. Redistribution priority.
- **Moderate Utilization (Orange/Blue Markers):** Stations with a steady flow but still maintaining availability.
- **Low Utilization (Green Markers):** Stations with surplus bikes that may need rebalancing.

## Data Structure
The dataset includes the following fields:
- **start_station_name:** The name of the bike station.
- **latitude, longitude:** Geolocation of each station.
- **trip_count:** Total trips originating from the station.
- **num_bikes_available:** Number of bikes available at the station.
- **utilization_rate:** Demand indicator calculated as \(\frac{\text{trip count}}{\text{num_bikes_available}}\).

## Implementation
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Track bike shortages and surplus using utilization metrics.
- **Folium-Based Visualization:** Interactive maps color-coded by utilization.
- **Actionable Insights for Supply Team:** Prioritize stations for redistribution efforts.
- **GitHub Documentation:** Track progress and updates.

## Next Steps
- **Automate Daily Reports:** Provide the supply team with daily updates on critical stations.
- **Redistribution Strategy:** Optimize bike placements to minimize shortages.
- **Expansion to Predictive Modeling:** Use machine learning to forecast demand spikes.

This utilization-focused approach ensures **better service efficiency**, **balanced supply distribution**, and **improved user experience** in the Capital Bike Share system.
